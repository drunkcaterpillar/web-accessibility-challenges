# Accessibility Adventures 🧠🕹️

_“You can't fix what you don't feel.”_

A bite-sized, game-style experience that lets you _feel_ how inaccessible design affects real people — and shows how to fix it using actual web accessibility standards (WCAG).

### 🕵️‍♀️ What's inside?

- Side-by-side simulations: "normal" vs. "disabled" vision, motion, cognition, etc.
- Real WCAG-based solutions built in.
- Pop-ups, flashing ads, fake UI chaos. You’ll hate it. That’s the point.
- Keyboard traps, shaky cursors, jargon floods, and more.
- End with a fake (but real-looking) certificate and shareable badge.
